# foundation-package-tools
Unofficial tools to unpack (and soon repack) Foundation's .package files (https://www.polymorph.games/)

`$ dismantle <name>.package`

-> files are extracted into `<name>`

`$ remantle <name>`

-> files are built from `<name>` into `<name>.package` (not fully implemented)

Both of these try to be sane and kind to the user. Please report all bugs and/or surprising results.
