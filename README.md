# DUE TO RECENT GITHUB POLICY CHANGES ALL MY PROJECTS HAVE BEEN MOVED TO [GITLAB](https://gitlab.com/pegasusepsilon)

# foundation-package-tools
Unofficial tools to unpack and repack Foundation's .package files (https://www.polymorph.games/)

`$ dismantle <name>.package`

-> files are extracted into `<name>`

`$ remantle <name>`

-> files are built from `<name>` into `<name>.package`

Both of these try to be sane and kind to the user. Please report all bugs and/or surprising results.
